# Welcome to LabShare

### Purpose
LabShare was developed to provide the staff at Washington University Public Health Fund with an easy-to-use portal to organize scientific proposals and their corresponding experiments. 

Registered faculty can log in to view all proposals - both active and closed, as well as any experiments (currently running or concluded) associated with each proposal. 

Registered faculty can create new proposals and/or new experiments, as well as comment on the proposals and experiments created by other staff members.
